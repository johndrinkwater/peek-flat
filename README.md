Peek flat shulker icons
=======================

Perfect addition to [Peek](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/peek) mod to theme your shulker boxes with a [flat pixelly look](https://github.com/ThePotatoKing55/2D-block-texture-pack)

Features
--------

- Mostly high-quality textures!
- Differentiation between otherwise identical blocks, like a shiny finish on the waxed copper items!
- Neat animations!
- A more cohesive visual style!

Other Stuff
-----------

This work heavily builds upon https://github.com/ThePotatoKing55/2D-block-texture-pack and https://github.com/Thanos1716/2d-block-item-resourcepack
which were inspired by stiw91's [Flat - 2D Items](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/flat-4806298/)

Optional dependency on [Respackopts](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/respackopts), which exposes settings to disable animations and emissive textures
